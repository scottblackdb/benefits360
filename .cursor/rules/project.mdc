# Cursor Agent Rules

# Do's and Don'ts
- If the apx development servers are started, don't regenerate the OpenAPI client.
- Prefer running apx related commands via mcp server if it's available.
- Prefer to add new components via shadcn mcp server if it's available.
- When using the API calls on the frontend, use error boundaries to handle errors.
- Run apx dev check command (via CLI) to check for errors in the project code after making changes.

## Package Management
- **Frontend:** Always use `bun` (never `npm`)
- **Python:** Always use `uv` (never `pip`)

## Component Management
- **Adding components:** When adding a new component via CLI command, always add `--yes` flag to skip confirmation
- **Component location:** If component was added to a wrong location (e.g. stored into `src/components` instead of `src/benefits360/ui/components`), move it to the proper folder
- **Component organization:** Prefer grouping components by functionality rather than by file type (e.g. `src/benefits360/ui/components/chat/`)

## Project Structure
Full-stack app: `src/benefits360/ui/` (React + Vite) and `src/benefits360/backend/` (FastAPI). Backend serves frontend at `/` and API at `/api`. API client auto-generated via `orval`.


## Models & API
- **3-model pattern:** `Entity` (DB), `EntityIn` (input), `EntityOut` (output)
- **API routes must have:** `response_model` and `operation_id` for client generation

## Frontend Rules
- **Routing:** `@tanstack/react-router` (routes in `src/benefits360/ui/routes/`)
- **Data fetching:** Always use `useXSuspense` hooks with `Suspense` and `Skeleton` components
- **Pattern:** Render static elements immediately, fetch API data with suspense
- **Components:** Use shadcn/ui, add to `src/benefits360/ui/components/`
- **Data access:** Use `selector()` function for clean destructuring (e.g., `const {data: profile} = useProfileSuspense(selector())`)

## Development Commands

**Start dev servers** (backend, frontend, OpenAPI watcher):
```bash
uv run apx dev start
```

**Check status** (shows running servers and ports):
```bash
uv run apx dev status
```

**View logs** (stored in `~/.apx/{app_id}/logs/`):
```bash
uv run apx dev logs              # All logs
uv run apx dev logs --ui         # Frontend only
uv run apx dev logs --backend    # Backend only
uv run apx dev tail              # Live stream
```

**Stop servers:**
```bash
uv run apx dev stop
```

**Build for production:**
```bash
uv run apx build
```

**OpenAPI generation** (auto-runs on each change with `dev start`):
```bash
uv run apx openapi               # Generate once
uv run apx openapi --watch       # Watch mode
```

**Note:** The OpenAPI watcher runs automatically with `dev start`. Manual generation is rarely needed.
